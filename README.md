# Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM)

## General Information and Purpose
- **Service Name/Title:** `nilm`
- **Description and purpose:** The NILM service disaggregates aggregate household energy consumption into device-level usage profiles without intrusive hardware or per-device meters. It applies advanced ML models (DAEs, clustering-based architectures, deep sequence models) to identify appliance usage patterns from whole-home smart meter data. Supports real-time energy disaggregation, flexibility estimation, incentive targeting, and user feedback.
- **Owner/Contact Information:** ICCS

## Functional Requirements
1. Ingest real-time household energy data from smart meters (e.g., Shelly 3EM).  
2. Disaggregate data into device-level consumption (washing machine, fridge, dishwasher, etc.).  
3. Support learning for multiple appliances via clustering strategies.  
4. Provide ON/OFF state classification and power reconstruction.  
5. Handle variable usage patterns and low-duty-cycle devices.  
6. Operate on 15-minute intervals aligned with MTUs.  
7. Deliver real-time disaggregated profiles for flexibility estimation.  
8. Integrate with other services via Kafka or REST APIs.  
9. Allow model updating/refinement with pilot data.  
10. Provide confidence metrics (e.g., F1-score, recall).  

---

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Latency < 5s per MTU.  
- Minimum F1-score ≥ 0.8 on high-impact appliances.  
- Maintain privacy: only aggregate signals processed.  
- Availability ≥ 99.5%.  
- Support offline retraining + fallback models.

## Data Model

### Inputs
- Aggregate household consumption (1s–1min).  
- Appliance-level consumption (for training/validation).  
- Optional appliance labels and metadata.  

### Outputs
- Time-series device-level disaggregated power (W).  
- ON/OFF state timelines.  

### Entities & Relationships
- **house_metadata:** static house info (address, area, year, energy_class).  
- **household_consumption:** whole-home energy usage per timestamp.  
- **device_metadata:** details per device (name, ip, device_id, relay, is_em).  
- **device_consumption:** actual device-level data for validation/training.  
- **disaggregated_output:** inferred usage from NILM models, linked to house + device.  

---

## Integration and Dependencies

### Roles
- **Aggregator:** Integrates metering, disaggregated consumption, forecasts → flexibility bids.  
- **Market Operator (HENEX):** Indirectly depends on forecast-informed bids.  

### Domains
- **Forecasting Zone:** Regional forecasting.  
- **Metering Points:** Provide real-time & historical usage.  
- **Disaggregated Output:** Provides appliance-level usage.  

---

## Security and Privacy
- Encrypted channels (TLS/HTTPS, MQTT with certs).  
- Anonymized datasets for training.  
- No PII stored or shared.  

---

### Initial Development
- Baseline DAEs tested on UK-DALE, REDD datasets.  
- Limitations: poor generalization for rare/low-usage devices.  

### Clustering-Enhanced Models
- Introduced **C-DAE framework** (clustering + DAE).  
- Improved classification for dishwashers, washing machines, washer-dryers.  
- Pilot retraining on Greek households.  

### Results
| Appliance | Model         | Recall | Precision | Accuracy | F1 | RMSE (W) |
|-----------|---------------|--------|-----------|----------|----|----------|
| Dishwasher | Baseline DAE | 0.58   | 0.13      | 0.79     | 0.21 | 289 |
|            | C-DAE (k=4)  | 0.99   | 0.95      | 0.95     | 0.97 | 205 |
| Washing Machine | Baseline DAE | 0.87 | 0.14 | 0.57 | 0.25 | 484 |
|                 | C-DAE (k=2) | 0.98 | 0.96 | 0.95 | 0.97 | 264 |
| Washer Dryer | Baseline DAE | 0.09 | 0.97 | 0.11 | 0.16 | 234 |
|              | C-DAE (k=2) | 0.96 | 0.97 | 0.93 | 0.96 | 218 |

**Key Improvements:**  
- F1-score jumps (e.g., dishwasher 0.21 → 0.97).  
- RMSE reduced (washing machine: −45%).  
- Better ON/OFF classification + noise resilience.  

**Impact:**  
- Enables real-time detection of controllable loads.  
- Improves customer profiling + incentive targeting.  
- Provides accurate input for flexibility optimization and bidding.
